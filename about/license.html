Guardsquare and/or its agents may inspect and review such business records, the Client’s premises and any other information relevant to verify the Client’s compliance with this Agreement upon reasonable notice (except where such notice would defeat the purpose of the audit), during normal business hours during the term of the Client’s user rights hereunder and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, provided that such inspection right may not be exercised more than twice during any calendar year period, except where Guardsquare has reasonable grounds to believe the Client is acting in breach of this Agreement. If such inspection shows that the Client has underpaid the amount of Fees due to Guardsquare (without limitation, as a result of the Client using the Software in excess of the licensed License Parameters), without prejudice to any other rights and remedies available to Guardsquare hereunder, the Client shall promptly pay the amount of any such underpayment to Guardsquare together with any applicable late payment interest (as per clause 7.2 hereof). The Client and Guardsquare shall each bear their own cost related to any such review and inspection, provided that in the event of an underpayment by the Client or any other contractual breach as determined by such review and inspection, all costs related to such review and inspection shall be borne by the Client, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies available to Guardsquare hereunder. </p>

<p>9.1    Guardsquare shall defend and indemnify the Client as specified herein against any claims brought by third parties to the extent such claim is based on an infringement of the Intellectual Property Rights of such third party by the Licensed Products and excluding any claims resulting from (i) the unauthorized use of the Licensed Products, (ii) the modification of any of the Licensed Products other than by Guardsquare, (iii) failure to use the most recent version of the Licensed Products made available to the Client, or failure to integrate or install any corrections to such Licensed Products issued by Guardsquare, if Guardsquare indicated that such update or correction was required to prevent a(n) (potential) infringement, (iv) use of the Licensed Products in combination with any non-Guardsquare products or services, or (v) the Software having been developed to the Client’s design or incorporating documents, materials, ideas, data or other information, provided by or on behalf of the Client.<br/>

<p>9.2    In the event the Licensed Products, in Guardsquare’s reasonable opinion, are likely to become or become the subject of a third-party infringement claim (as per clause 9.1), Guardsquare shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to: (i) modify the ((allegedly) infringing part of the Licensed Products so that they become non-infringing while preserving equivalent functionality; (ii) obtain for the Client a license to continue using the Licensed Products in accordance with this Agreement; or (iii) terminate the relevant license and pay to the Client an amount equal to a pro rata portion of the License Fee paid to Guardsquare hereunder for that portion of the Licensed Products which is the subject of such infringement, such portion equaling any pre-paid Fees covering the period after actual termination. </p>
<p>9.3    The foregoing states the entire liability and obligation of Guardsquare and the sole remedy of the Client with respect to any infringement or alleged infringement of any Intellectual Property Rights caused by the Licensed Products or any part thereof. </p>

<p>10.3    The Client agrees that Guardsquare can only be held liable as per the terms of this Section 10 to the extent damages suffered by the Client are directly and solely attributable to Guardsquare. The exclusions and limitations of liability under this Section shall operate to the benefit of Guardsquare’s affiliates and subcontractors under this Agreement to the same extent such provisions operate to the benefit of Guardsquare.</p>
<p>10.4    The Client’s exclusive remedy for any claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be for Guardsquare, upon receipt of written notice, to use reasonable efforts to cure the breach or default at its expense, and failing that, Guardsquare’s liability shall be limited as set forth in this Agreement. The Client shall have a duty to mitigate damages for which Guardsquare is responsible.</p>

<p>11.1    This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for the term of the Order to which it relates. As a default (unless deviated from in the relevant Order), Orders (including any Software licenses and Support Services contracted pursuant to such an Order) are entered into for an initial one (1) year term (the “Initial Term”). Upon expiry of this Initial Term, the Orders shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods (each a “Renewal Term”), unless terminated by either Party on giving at least three (3) months’ written notice prior to the expiry of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term. Neither Party shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement or an Order in whole or in part for convenience save as expressly permitted herein.</p>
<p>11.2    Termination of the Agreement shall not automatically result in termination of any Orders, which must be separately terminated as set forth herein. Time and Material Professional Services (portions of) Orders may be terminated by the Client for convenience only if expressly so stipulated in the relevant Order, on giving such notice as specified in such Order. Fixed price Professional Services (portions of) Orders may not be terminated for convenience, failure of which shall result in the full fixed price becoming payable by the Client upon termination.  </p>
<p>11.3    Either Party may terminate this Agreement, the Support Services (if the default relates to the Support Services) or the portion of the Order that is the subject of the default, by written notice to the other Party, if the other Party materially breaches this Agreement, the Support Services related provisions or a specific portion of such Order (as applicable) and fails to (i) cure such breach within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of a default notice by the defaulting Party, and (ii) make substantial progress to cure such breach and implement a remedial plan that results in a cure of such breach within sixty (60) days from receipt of such default notice, provided that Guardsquare shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement (in whole or in part) (or alternatively suspend its obligations and/or the Client’s user rights granted hereunder) on giving written notice in the event the Client breaches the license terms hereunder or infringes Guardsquare’s Intellectual Property Rights.</p>
<p>11.4    Either Party may terminate this Agreement or an Order by written notice to the other Party, effective as of the date of delivery of such notice, if the other Party becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding or otherwise liquidates or ceases to do business.
Consequences of termination.</p>
<p>11.5    Upon termination of an Order for whatever reason, the licenses granted to the Client pursuant to such Order in accordance with Section 2 of this Agreement shall automatically terminate and the Client shall return to Guardsquare all copies (in whatever form or medium) of the Licensed Products.</p>
<p>11.6    Upon termination for convenience by the Client of an Order or any of the Licensed Product licenses other than as expressly permitted in Section 11.1, the full License Fees for the Initial Term and then current Renewal Term (as applicable) shall remain payable by the Client. In the event the Client terminates an Order or the Support Services for convenience other than as expressly permitted in Section 11.1, the Support Fees shall remain payable by the Client for the full then current term (Initial Term or then current Renewal Term, as applicable). In the event the Client terminates the Agreement or an Order for convenience other than as expressly permitted in Section 11.2, the full Professional Services Fees and reimbursable expenses payable in respect of such Order shall remain payable by the Client.</p>
<p>11.7    In the event Guardsquare terminates the Agreement, Licensed Product licenses, Support Services or an Order pursuant to Sections 11.3 or 11.4, the Client’s payment obligations shall be as per Section 11.6 above.</p>

<p>12.2    The Client acknowledges that Guardsquare’s performance of this Agreement is dependent on the Client’s cooperation and the Client agrees to cooperate with Guardsquare to enable the latter to adequately perform its obligations under this Agreement. Such cooperation shall include (i) timely making available management decisions, information, approvals and acceptances; and (ii) at no cost to Guardsquare, providing timely and appropriate access to Client facilities, personnel, equipment, resources and systems, including its owned and licensed software, tools, data, databases and methodologies, and any relevant information and documentation (such information and documentation to be accurate and complete) as necessary to facilitate performance of the Agreement.</p>
<p>12.3    The Client agrees that it shall not, during the term of this Agreement and for a period of one year after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, without Guardsquare’s prior written consent, directly or indirectly (including through its affiliates or recruitment agencies), hire or otherwise engage, in whatever capacity (including as an employee or consultant), or solicit the services of, any personnel member of Guardsquare or its affiliates, while such person is employed or engaged by Guardsquare or its affiliates and during six months after such employment or engagement ends. For the purpose of this section, “hire” means to employ an individual as an employee or engage such individual as an independent contractor, whether on a full-time, part-time or temporary basis. 
The Client agrees that it shall not encourage third parties to act in a manner that would constitute a breach of this section, if such action had been performed by the Client. 
In case the above non-solicitation/non-hire obligations are not complied with and give rise to actual employment/engagement of Guardsquare’s or its affiliates’ personnel, the Client shall compensate Guardsquare by paying, upon a first request, a lump-sum amount corresponding to twelve times the gross salary/compensation each such person so hired/engaged earned with Guardsquare or its affiliates (as applicable) during the last full month such person worked for Guardsquare or its affiliates.</p>
<p>12.4    Any timeframe for performance specified in this Agreement or an Order shall be indicative target dates only, unless expressly stipulated to be binding milestones. </p>
<p>12.5    The terms and conditions of this Agreement may be modified or amended only by written agreement executed by a duly authorized representative of both Parties. The terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived only by a written document signed by the Party entitled to the benefit of such terms or conditions. No such waiver or consent shall be deemed to be or shall constitute a waiver or consent with respect to any other terms or conditions of this Agreement, whether or not similar. Each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which it was given, and shall not constitute a continuing waiver or consent.</p>
<p>12.6    The Client may not assign or transfer this Agreement (whether in whole or in part) to any third party (including without limitation its affiliates) without the prior written consent of Guardsquare. Guardsquare shall be free to transfer or assign the Agreement (whether in whole or in part). Guardsquare shall also be free to subcontract performance of this Agreement to its affiliates, to contractors and to third party service providers without having to obtain the Client’s prior consent, provided that Guardsquare shall remain responsible towards the Client in respect of such subcontracted services.</p>
<p>12.7    In the event that any Party is prevented from performing or is unable to perform any of its non-monetary obligations under this Agreement due to any Act of God, fire, casualty, flood, earthquake, war, strike, lockout, epidemic, destruction of production facilities, riot, insurrection, material unavailability, or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the Party invoking this section, such Party shall give prompt written notice to the other Party, its performance shall be excused, and the time for the performance shall be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to such occurrences (or such longer period as is reasonably required as reasonably demonstrated and substantiated by the affected Party).  </p>
<p>12.8    The Client acknowledges that, in using the Software pursuant to the Agreement, the Software may collect and process (telemetry) data, which data allows Guardsquare to monitor the Client’s use of the Software and which data may be used by Guardsquare for (among others) marketing, trend analysis, benchmarking purposes, or to further develop the Software. 
To the extent such consent is legally required, the Client hereby expressly consents to such data collection and processing. Such data may include (without being limitative) anonymized (namely without sensitive data regarding strings and classes related to Application source code being captured, however such data may still be linked to the Client’s account) configuration data (providing (among others) information regarding the Software features used by the Client), and environmental data (including information regarding the build systems and program languages used by the Client). The actual types of data captured will be detailed in the Documentation (as it may change over time). 
The Client may at any time decide to disable these data capturing functionalities, by changing the Software configuration settings to this effect. In such event, no more data capturing as per the terms of this clause will take place once these functionalities have been disabled.
The Client will also be able to configure the Software such that the Client obtains a copy of the telemetry data uploaded to Guardsquare, allowing the Client to keep visibility on the data so captured.
As at the Effective Date, no personal data is envisaged to be collected or otherwise processed by Guardsquare pursuant to this clause 12.8 (“process” and “personal data” each as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”)). If and to the extent Guardsquare is considered – under applicable law – to process personal data in capturing and processing data pursuant to this clause, (i) the Client hereby consents to such data processing to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law and subject to the disabling option set out above, and (ii) Guardsquare shall be the data controller (as defined in the GDPR) in respect of such processing and shall comply with its obligations under applicable data protection laws in this respect. In the event such personal data processing were to take place: 
- Guardsquare shall inform (posting such information on a designated Guardsquare webpage accessible by the Client shall suffice for such purpose) the Client of the details of such processing as may be required under applicable law;
- upon the Client’s reasonable written request and no more than once per Agreement contract year (unless required under applicable law), Guardsquare shall make available to the Client such information as reasonably deemed necessary by Guardsquare to demonstrate its compliance with its personal data processing obligations hereunder (posting such information on a designated Guardsquare webpage accessible by the Client shall suffice for such purpose). To this end, Guardsquare may allow a reputable third-party auditor chosen by Guardsquare to perform audits on the Client’s behalf (to the extent such audit right is available to the Client under applicable law) and the Client hereby authorizes Guardsquare to issue such mandate to the third-party auditor; 
- upon the Client’s written request, Guardsquare shall destroy the personal data, subject to Guardsquare retaining any copies as may be required by applicable law.
    The Client acknowledges and agrees that Guardsquare may retain and use data collected hereunder for the purposes set out herein during the term of the Agreement as well as after its termination, subject always to any applicable legal limitations in this respect.</p>
<p>12.9    Guardsquare may freely use Feedback without attribution or the need for Guardsquare (or any third party) to pay the Client or any third party any royalties or other fees of any kind.</p>
<p>12.10    This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Guardsquare’s country/state of incorporation without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. In case of any dispute arising in respect of this Agreement, whether during or after its term, the Parties shall first attempt to amicably settle such dispute. Where no such amicable settlement can be reached within a reasonable period from the dispute having arisen, the dispute shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the city/state of incorporation of Guardsquare. </p>
<p>12.11    If a court of competent jurisdiction determines any provision, or any portion thereof, of this Agreement to be unenforceable or invalid, then such provision shall be deemed limited to the extent that such court deems it valid or enforceable and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>12.12    The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that they have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and that in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>12.13    This Agreement does not constitute a partnership agreement nor does it create a joint venture or agency relationship between Guardsquare and the Client. Neither Party shall take any action or make any representation to any third party that would be inconsistent with the foregoing sentence. Neither Party shall be liable for the representations, acts, or omissions of the other Party unless expressly provided otherwise under the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>12.14    No failure or delay by a Party hereto in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement, and no course of dealing between the Parties hereto, shall operate as a waiver of any such right, power or remedy of the Party. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy under this Agreement by a Party hereto, nor any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce any such right, power or remedy, shall preclude such Party from any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy hereunder. The election of any remedy by a Party hereto shall not constitute a waiver of the right of such Party to pursue other available remedies, save as expressly stipulated otherwise in the Agreement.  </p>
<p>12.15    As of the Effective Date, Guardsquare shall be entitled to reference the Client as a Guardsquare Client, in accordance with the Client’s reasonable instructions (e.g. as regards use of Client logo) notified to Guardsquare in this respect.  </p>
<p>12.16    This Agreement (including its Schedules and Orders) constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements, representations or understandings between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof. All such Schedules, as the same may be amended from time to time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. The terms of this Agreement shall be deemed included in the Orders by reference. No statement, representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of any kind not expressly set forth in this Agreement or an Order shall affect, or be used to interpret, change or restrict, the express terms and conditions of this Agreement or an Order. Additional or deviating terms and conditions (such as, for example, purchase orders or other documents of the Client or third parties) are hereby expressly refused and rejected, even if Guardsquare does not refuse or reject such terms and conditions on a case by case basis.   </p>
